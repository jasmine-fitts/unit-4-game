Included in the game are four crystals which are displayed as buttons on the page

At the start of the game the player will be shown a random number

When the player clicks on a crystal it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score

The amount of the crystal is hidden until the player clicks a crsytal --- when they do the player's score will be updated on the player's score counter

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game

The player losses if their score goes above the random number

The game restarts whenever the play wins or losses

When the game begins, the play should see a new random number --- all the crsytals will have four new hidden values and the player's score will reset to 0
